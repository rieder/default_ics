Set of initial conditions based on a Plummer(1911) model with 40.000 particles and a Salpeter initial mass function with masses between 0.1-100 MSun. Stellar masses are shown at 0, 3, 5 and 10 Gyr, the positions and velocities are constant.

The initial conditions are available with SI units and N-body/HÃ©non units.

To create these initial conditions we used the codes below. Please cite the appropriate articles indicated when using them.
